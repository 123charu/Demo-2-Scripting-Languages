External CSS

There are 3 types of css which are 
1)Inline CSS
2)Internal CSS
3)External CSS
External CSS is used to apply the same styling in more than one webpages unlike the other two types of css where they are used for a single webpages only.
to use this external css we firstly have to make a seperate ".css" file and then we have to link that file in the multiple webpages wherever it is required.

Syntax
<link rel="Stylesheet" href="style1.css">

Example
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is Scripting Language deno 2 question 2 </h1>
</body>
</html>

style1.css
body{
background-color:red;
height:1000px;
width:1000px;
}
h1{
color:black;
}
